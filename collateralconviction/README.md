# Collateral Conviction
## Fall 2022

This was my final for my causal inference class. The data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Surveys project.

For this assignment we were asked to answer a question causal in nature in the realm of social good. We were also asked to demonstrate specific skills we learned in data cleaning, validation, exploration, and visualization alongside our causal analysis.

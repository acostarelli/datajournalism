# Middlesex Bias
## Spring 2022

This was my final for my introductory data science class.

This assignment was similar to the midterm project except we were expected to use some of the newer data analysis techniques we learned, and we were encouraged to use data outside of the General Social Survey. I chose to use data from a local criminal court system.
